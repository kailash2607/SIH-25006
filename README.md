Problem Title

SIH 25006: Development of a Digital Farm Management Portal for implementing Biosecurity measures in Pig and Poultry Farms

⸻

Problem Description

Background

Biosecurity is a cornerstone of animal health management, particularly in the pig and poultry sectors, where disease outbreaks such as Avian Influenza and African Swine Fever can cause significant economic losses, threaten food security, and disrupt rural livelihoods. Despite its importance, many farmers—especially smallholders in resource-limited areas—struggle to access practical, actionable information on biosecurity protocols, risk assessment tools, and regulatory compliance requirements.

Problem Statement

There is an urgent need for a user-friendly, digital platform that empowers farmers to implement, monitor, and sustain robust biosecurity practices on their farms. This portal should offer end-to-end solutions for farm-level biosecurity management by integrating:
	•	Customizable risk assessment tools based on local epidemiological conditions
	•	Interactive training modules and best practice guidelines tailored for pig and poultry production systems
	•	Compliance tracking features aligned with regulatory frameworks to help farmers work toward disease-free compartment recognition
	•	Real-time alerts and monitoring dashboards for disease outbreaks and biosecurity breaches
	•	Multilingual and mobile-first design to ensure accessibility in remote and rural areas

The platform should also enable data collection and analysis for policy support, foster collaborative networking among stakeholders (farmers, veterinarians, extension workers, etc.), and promote long-term resilience and sustainability in the livestock sector.

⸻

Expected Outcomes
	•	Enhanced farmer awareness and education on biosecurity
	•	Improved risk management and self-assessment at farm level
	•	Easy access to customized biosecurity protocols and guidelines
	•	Digital record-keeping and compliance tracking
	•	Timely alerts and disease notifications to farmers
	•	Healthier livestock and increased farm productivity
	•	Empowerment of small and marginal farmers
	•	Support to authorities in data-driven surveillance and policy-making
	•	Stronger collaboration across the livestock ecosystem
	•	Improved national preparedness for zoonotic and transboundary diseases

Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is a Digital Biosecurity Farm Management Portal designed specifically for pig and poultry farms. It integrates risk assessment, training, compliance tracking, real-time monitoring, and communication tools into a single unified platform.

The solution includes the following key components:

1. Smart Biosecurity Risk Assessment System
	•	AI-based dynamic questionnaires tailored to species (pig/poultry), farm size, and region.
	•	Continuous scoring model that updates risk based on new inputs from farmers.
	•	Visual risk heatmaps to show vulnerable areas of the farm.

2. Interactive Training and Capacity-Building Modules
	•	Short, vernacular-language videos and animated guides on hygiene, disease prevention, waste management, and farm entry protocols.
	•	Gamified learning with quizzes, badges, and progress tracking.
	•	Offline mode for rural farmers with limited connectivity.

3. Digital Compliance & Record-Keeping
	•	Automated logs for vaccination, feed usage, mortality, waste disposal, and farm entry permissions.
	•	Compliance checklists aligned with DoAH&D guidelines.
	•	Exportable reports for audits and compartment recognition.

4. Real-Time Alerts & Monitoring Dashboard
	•	Early warning alerts for nearby outbreaks using govt. database integration.
	•	Notifications for farm hygiene lapses, missing vaccination dates, and health deviations.
	•	IoT integration for temperature, humidity, and movement sensors (optional but future-ready).

5. Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration Hub
	•	Chat and video-call interface to connect farmers with veterinarians and extension workers.
	•	Community forum for sharing best practices.
	•	Digital bulletin board for government advisories.

6. Multilingual, Mobile-First Design
	•	Support for multiple Indian languages.
	•	Works smoothly on low-end smartphones and low bandwidth.
	•	Simple visual UI for farmers with low digital literacy.

How It Addresses the Problem
	•	Makes biosecurity accessible, understandable, and actionable for small farmers.
	•	Reduces disease risk through real-time guidance.
	•	Ensures transparency and accountability through digital records.
	•	Offers a scalable solution aligned with national biosecurity goals.

Innovation and Uniqueness
	•	First-of-its-kind AI-powered, region-specific biosecurity risk engine for pig and poultry farms.
	•	Rural-friendly offline-first design for low-connectivity users.
	•	End-to-end integration of training, compliance, IoT monitoring, and alerts.
	•	Enables data-driven policy support for government agencies.

2. Methodology & Implementation Workflow

Step 1: Requirement Analysis
	•	Interaction with farmers, veterinarians, and officials.
	•	Identification of core biosecurity behaviour patterns.

Step 2: System Architecture Design
	•	3-tier architecture:
Client → API Layer → Cloud Database

Step 3: AI Risk Assessment Model
	•	Train ML model on disease history, geography, and farm practices.
	•	Generate dynamic risk scoring.

Step 4: Development of Portal & App
	•	Build responsive UI with multilingual support.
	•	Implement dashboards, alerts, and record-keeping modules.

Step 5: IoT Integration (Optional Phase 2)
	•	Sensors for temperature, humidity, perimeter control.

Step 6: Testing
	•	Usability testing with farmers.
	•	Field trials in selected farms.

Step 7: Deployment
	•	Cloud-based deployment with API gateways and CDN.
	•	Offline support for rural access.

Step 8: Monitoring & Maintenance
	•	Monthly updates based on new disease data.
	•	Continuous improvement of AI accuracy.

Feasibility and Viability

1. Feasibility Analysis
	•	Technical Feasibility: Achievable using existing technologies (ML, mobile apps, cloud).
	•	Operational Feasibility: Farmers already use smartphones; simple UX ensures adoption.
	•	Economic Feasibility: Low-cost deployment with government support.

2. Potential Challenges & Risks
	•	Limited digital literacy among small farmers.
	•	Internet connectivity issues in rural areas.
	•	Data privacy and security concerns.
	•	Adoption resistance due to traditional practices.
